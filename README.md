### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mikal

Software developer current working on [concerto card](https://www.concertocard.com), my [digital garden](https://www.mikal.online), [scalaquote](https://github.com/mikalcallahan/scalaquote), and an iOS/watchOS meditation app (in TestFlight).
Currently I'm hacking away in `typescript`, `swift`, and `scala` and have a fondness for functional programming, technology's role in improving our life/connection with others, and mindfulness.
